# micro-riscv
_Collection of documentation and scripts for running a small RISC-V based OS_

 - Using FreeBSD as the basis for the OS as there is an active port. 
 - The host OS is OpenBSD, utilizing qemu and pf to facilitate building of the image and running the micro-riscv os itself. 
 - The basic idea is to get the smallest bootable image possible, containing at least a shell and compiler.
